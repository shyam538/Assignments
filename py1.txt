1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a
multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

[n for n in range(2000, 3201) if (n%7 == 0 and n%5 != 0)]

2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them
printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

first=input("Enter your First Name:")
last=input("Enter your Last Name:")
print(f"{last} {first}")

3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.

from math import pi
d=12
r=d/2
print("The volume of sphere is:", (4/3)*pi*(r**3))
